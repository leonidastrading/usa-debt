# News Alerts

Watches market news as it breaks and emails you when a stock in a headline starts moving. Each alert is
paper-traded in the direction of the move and the website records how it turned out.

## How it works

Two parts share one Neon Postgres database:

- **Monitor** (`worker/`, runs on Railway, always on)
  - Listens to Alpaca's live news stream (Benzinga headlines, each tagged with its tickers). If the stream drops,
    it polls the news API every 15 seconds until it reconnects.
  - For every fresh headline tagged with 1–4 US tickers, watches those stocks for 30 minutes. Roundups tagged
    with many tickers, stocks under $3 and thinly traded stocks are skipped.
  - Checks prices every 5 seconds (IEX feed). The price at the first check after the headline is the starting
    point; when a stock is 1.5% or more away from it on two checks in a row, that's an alert.
  - On an alert: saves it, places a paper trade in the direction of the move (about $2,000, market order, only
    during regular hours, closed after 30 minutes or before the close) and emails you.
  - Afterwards fills in the trade's fill prices and P&L and the stock's price 15 and 60 minutes after the alert
    and at the next day's close.
- **Website** (Next.js on Vercel): every alert from the last 30 days, how riding each move would have done at
  +15 min, +60 min and the next close, the paper P&L, and whether the monitor is checking in.

Trades only ever go to `paper-api.alpaca.markets`; the code has no way to reach a live account.

## Setup

1. **Database**: in Vercel, create a Neon database (Storage → Create → Neon) and connect it to the
   `news-alerts` project. Copy its `DATABASE_URL`.
2. **Alpaca**: Paper Trading → API Keys → generate. Copy the key ID and secret.
3. **Resend** (email): sign up at resend.com with the address you want alerts sent to, then create an API key.
4. **Railway**: New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo → this repo. In the service settings set the root
   directory to `news-alerts` (and the branch, if not the default). `railway.json` sets the start command.
   Add the variables from `.env.example`.

The monitor creates the database tables the first time it starts.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run build && npm run typecheck
npm run dev       # website, needs DATABASE_URL
npm run worker    # monitor, needs the variables in .env.example
```
